## User Story

```
As busy modern day working professionals...
We want help to minimise stress when planning what to do in our free time... 
So that we can make an informed and stress free decision about where to eat or what are good activities near us.
When we open the app
Then we will be presented with a random selection of activities.
When we press “filter options”
Then we’re presented with the ability to refine our search by cost/location and activity.
When we click on any of these, then click “Refine search”
Then a new section pops up showing new options relevant to our refinement. 
When we click on ‘website’
Then we are redirected to the relevant search results website to book our dining/activity.
```
